ah Sunday brunch back in Madison. I was really excited to try this place but I think I got slightly disappointed. First of all, not enough parking! Probably a total of 16 stalls in the tiny one way parking lot.. so do plan on car pooling here. I circled around the street 2 times before finding a parking space on the side street about 3 blocks away. It might just be Sunday though.. who knows. I do think the building and decor is kinda cool.. felt like a good old diner with a retro kick. so here comes the food part.. I ordered corn beef hash.. food was lukewarm. I usually like my hot food hot.. not like somewhere between hot and cold. It was greasy too. not a fan. I did like the side fruits that came with it..def gave my greasy hash a little break. I think I would come try their dessert next time. The pie and bakery goods look more yummy.. until next time. Oh btw our waiter was really friendly and unobtrusive so if you are the type of person into good table service.

Solid donut shop. + Nice parking lot + Great selection of donuts available, even at 11:30am on a Sunday (most other places are sold out) + Totally reasonable prices + Donuts are good; I'd say on par with most places, but not quite as good as Greenbush - Presentation/cabinet could use some work - very narrow space and it's nearly impossible to see what's available

Great place, great location, and for downtown EXCELLENT parking. The food was wonderful.  And despite the fact that every table seemed to be filled with holiday office parties, we were seated and served quickly.

The pros:  - fresh ingredients - attention to detail  - variety of foods, snacks, goodies and drinks The cons: - expensive - location / parking inconvenient Brief review: All in all, a good place to hang out and grab a drink with a friend when it's nice outside. Friendly, prompt service. Clean tables. Great atmosphere!  The only real problem is your wallet is going to be much, much lighter after you leave.  If you're going because you're hungry and you want value, this isn't your place.  If you're going to hang with friends to relax and enjoy the day, I think you'll enjoy the place.

Very good place.  NIce romantic ambience.  Great wines, and good food. Small parking area, but okay.  Good place to meet with your business clients.

"I know my 2 girlfriends that absolutely LOVE this place will balk at my 4 stars instead of 5. But honestly, I think this place is slightly overrated. Don't get me wrong, I like this place, and I oblige them every time they want to go, but I think 4 stars is just right for the rating.  We went there this weekend, and the typical scenario went down. Parking was cramped (lucked out to get a ""valet"" spot which I parked into myself as it was right out front by the entrance - no I'm not waiting for you Mr. Valet Dude to get into my car and pull it forward into the spot right in front of my face, thank you very much), and there was a short wait (maybe 10-15 minutes). We sat outside, which wasn't ideal since it was cold and drizzly, but we had patio heaters on both sides of our table so it was OK.  Sadly we didn't make their $5 wine special, which ends at 5pm, so we were paying full price for the glasses of wine - ranging from $8 to about $12-13. I don't know about you, but I really am not a fan of paying $10 for a glass of wine when I can pay that for an entire bottle. But alas, I had 2 different wines through the course of the night, both on recommendation from the servers, and both decent.  We ordered the infamous bruschetta, with the 4 choices being: smoked salmon (YUM!), warm artichoke (tasty), roasted red pepper (still good), and white bean with tomato (OK, but nothing to write home about).  For dinner, I had the half & half combo (where you get to choose 2 different items), and I chose the mixed green salad (REALLY delicious, with an awesome combination of greens, pears, grapes, gorgonzola cheese, pecans, & poppyseed dressing) and half of a turkey/pesto pannini. The pannini was QUITE boring. Didn't have much flavor at all. I think it was lacking on the pesto.  And honestly, this is what I come to expect at Postino. Some things are just unbelievable and you want to lick your plate clean, and other things are simply boring and tasteless (like the white bean/tomato bruschetta and the turkey/pesto pannini).  And hence my rating of 4 stars rather than 5. If the parking was easier, the wines were always $5 a glass, and the food was consistent, I would give it 5 stars. Fair enough?  :)"
