Good truck stop dining at the right price. We love coming here on the weekends when we don't feel like cooking.
If you like lot lizards, you'll love the Pine Cone!
Enjoyable experience for the whole family. The wait staff was courteous and friendly; the food was reasonably priced and a good value. A word of advice--LEAVE ROOM FOR DESSERT! the deserters are great but huge! Plan to bring some home
One of my favorite truck stop diners with solid food and friendly, quick service. My god, those desserts are huge! I can't imagine eating that giant cream puff.  All the food we had was delicious and I love how they leave a carafe of coffee on the table. Love this place. Would definitely be back if I was in the area!
Only went here once about a year and a half ago, but they had great pancakes! My only problem with it at the time was that they allowed smoking, so I left smelling like a cigarette. With the change in law, I'm sure the atmosphere has improved!
